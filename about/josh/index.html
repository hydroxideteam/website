		<p>Nice to meet you.</p>

		<p class = "subtitle">A brief introduction.</p>
		<p>I am a hobbyist programmer and game developer. Currently I am in high school, and I spend my free time working out, studying, and building my resume.</p>

		<p>My main interests are mathematics, history, and engineering. I also enjoy politics, cooking, and the outdoors.</p>

		<p>I am proficient in a few programming languages, namely Lua, Java, and C/C++, and I have limited experience in a wide range, from ASM to JavaScript. I also take interest in robotics and mathematics in general.</p>


		<p>I don't feel game programming goes any further than a hobby for me, as I don't have much motivation for it these days. I used to be highly invested into it, but I've gotten burned out.</p>

		<p>I'll add more to this page as needed, thanks for the read.</p>
